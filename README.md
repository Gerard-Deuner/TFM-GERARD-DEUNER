# Single-cell Characterization of the TME in pMMR/MSS CRC & EC Liver Metastatic Tumors upon Dual ICI Therapy

*Abstract*: Colorectal (CRC) and endometrial cancers (EC) are classified into two genetic subtypes: mismatch repair-deficient and microsatellite instability-high (dMMR/MSI), and mismatch repair-proficient and microsatellite stable (pMMR/MSS) tumors. dMMR/MSI tumors exhibit an “immune hot” phenotype, characterized by high immune cell infiltration, and are therefore associated with effective response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. However, ICI treatment in pMMR/MSS tumors remains a significant challenge due to their “immune cold” phenotype, and the immune dynamics within their tumor microenvironment (TME) following ICI treatment have not been fully described. This study aims to investigate the TME composition, heterogeneity and clonal expansion dynamics of pMMR/MSS tumors following dual ICI, with the goal of uncovering factors that contribute to ICI resistance and drivers of positive response. Here, we analyze tumor samples collected before and after ICI, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell TCR repertoire sequencing (scTCR-seq) data from five liver-metastatic CRC and EC (LM-CRC/EC) patients enrolled in the Serpentine clinical trial, who received adjuvant dual anti-PDL1 and anti-CTLA4 ICI treatment. We found that dual ICI induces a shift in composition of the T lymphocytic compartment towards local immune hub characterized by an increase of pre-exhausted tissue resident CD8 T cells and CD4 T cells enriched with a follicular helper phenotype, and promotes expansion of both CD4 T and CD8 T de novo and pre-existing clonotypes that is also reflected in peripheral blood. Additionally, our findings highlight the crucial role of the myeloid compartment in influencing ICI outcomes. Our research reveals how the TME is shaped upon dual ICI and uncovers biological insights into the mechanisms of resistance and response to ICI therapy in pMMR/MSS LM-CRC/EC patients, highlighting the relevance of T cell expansion dynamics in ICI response and the role of the myeloid environment in immune evasion as a potential approach to treat these tumors.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73369379-0003-4dee-af48-62e0fd593eb3)
